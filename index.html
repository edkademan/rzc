<h3 id="sec-1-1">Energy Consumption and Weather</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The plot below describes outdoor air temperatures and the rate of
retreat center energy consumption for the past few months. These
data come from
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Ensemble HVAC system,
</li>
<li>the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and
</li>
<li>the gas and electric meters.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ensemble samples the outdoor air temperature several times per hour
and NOAA provides historical maximum and minimum daily temperatures
for Batavia. After comparing the two it became obvious that Ensemble
was providing readings that were predictably higher than reasonable
for very cold days. This is almost certainly because the Chapin Mill
thermistor is too close to the kitchen which is usually much warmer
than the rest of the retreat center.  I fit a statistical model to
the two sets of temperatures&#x2014;Ensemble and NOAA&#x2014;and used the
results to adjust the Ensemble readings so that they were more
realistic. Then I determined the daily min and max readings and
plotted the range over time.
</p>

<p>
Gas values are in thousands of cubic feet per day and electricity
values are in killowatt hours per day. (So I guess that makes the
units for electricity 1000/24 &asymp; 42 watts.) Using historical
billing data we can estimate the price of gas and electricity and so
can convert the two types to dollars and add them up. Thus one of
the panels in the plot describes the rate of overall cost of energy
consumption.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="energy.png" alt="energy.png" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
Before modeling the data in a more formal way it might be useful to
consider a simple summary that compares the rates of retreat center
energy consumption for different users and different seasons. If we
restrict ourselves to time periods from February 2015 through June
2017 during which the center was hosting either a sesshin, a rental,
or absolutely nothing, and then plot the meter readings we get the
figure below. (Here "rental" implies just the two outside
organizations described in the following paragraphs, namely the
Toronto and UR groups. Also, winter is November, December, January,
February, and March and summer is June, July, and August.) The plot
summarizes&#x2014;for each combination of occupancy/season&#x2014;the
distribution of power values observed for both natural gas and
electricity, and the derived dollar values. Each such combination
has a heavy horizontal line corresponding to the median, an
enclosing box describing the middle 50 percent, and whiskers
extending out to the extreme values. For example, the upper
right-hand figure tells us that during a winter sesshin the center
is burning up gas and electricity at an average rate of a little
over 50 dollars per day, and that half of the observed readings are
within 45 and 60 dollars.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="regime.png" alt="regime.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In order to study the dependence of gas consumption on outdoor
temperature more particularly I looked at the time period from early
February 2015 to early May 2015. The plot corresponding to that
period is below. During that time span there were several different
types of events including
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rochester Zen Center sesshins,
</li>
<li>a  Satipaññā 
     Insight Meditation Toronto (simt) retreat and
</li>
<li>a University of Rochester MBSR (ur) retreat.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The plot assigns different colors to these different periods. Most
of the time that fell outside of scheduled events qualifies as idle,
meaning that there was no activity going on aside from that required
to maintain a minimal crew. (The uncolored non-idle times were those
for which some extra energy consumption was going on. For example
the cold room may have been running or the zendo may have been
heated for sesshin setup.)
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="energy2.png" alt="energy2.png" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
If you look carefully at the above plots you may notice&#x2014;as you
would expect&#x2014;that gas consumption decreases as it gets warmer
outside. The next figure is a scatterplot of idle gas usage versus
average outside air temperature for the period from February 2015
through July 2015. That is, any given gas value is the rate at which
we used gas over a two-day period and the corresponding temperature
value is the average of the temperature readings over that period.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="scatter.png" alt="scatter.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
A possible elaboration of this report might consider electricity
consumption for the summer months as opposed to winter months as
well. However, right now it looks overwhelmingly likely to me that
the results would not be very interesting.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Natural gas</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
For a given level of occupancy of the retreat center it would be
natural to consider gas consumption as consisting of two parts:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a base rate that doesn't change significantly from day to day,
and
</li>
<li>an additional rate that scales with the outdoor
temperature. (The colder it gets the greater this part.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In what follows I have assumed that the average base rate is common
among all the different retreat center occupants but not the
scaling factor that applies to outdoor temperature. This might not
be valid if there were reason to think that different occupants
stressed the heating system differently independently of how cold
it was outside. For example, if one group took more hot showers
than another or ran the dishwasher or clothes washers and driers
more often. But in light of the magnitude of the effects described
below it seemed likely to me that these possible differences would
not be important.
</p>

<p>
The data support a fairly good estimate of the base rate and very
robust estimates of the outdoor temperature scaling factors. These
scaling factors relate gas consumption in ccf (100s of cubic feet)
per day to degrees Fahrenheit. 95% confidence intervals are

<p>
Roughly speaking these imply that the incremental consumption
associated with a 1 degree drop in outside air temperature is
normally <code>0.57</code> ccf per day. During sesshin
this increases by <code>105</code> percent to
<code>1.16</code> ccf per day and during a SIMT retreat it
increases by <code>193</code> percent to 
<code>1.66</code> ccf per day. (The UR gas consumption is
essentially the same as that for SIMT.)
</p>

<p>
Historically the price per ccf of natural gas for Chapin Mill is
<code>55</code> cents. Altogether the scales and base rate
tell us that if the average outside air temperature is say 25
degrees Fahrenheit then the amount spent on gas per day during
idle, sesshin and SIMT/UR periods would be around
<code>15</code>,
<code>28</code>, and
<code>39</code>
dollars respectively.
</p>

<p>
The plot below describes both observed and predicted gas
consumption for the study period. As before in the raw data plot
the units are thousands of cubic feet per day. (There are only
predictions for times that are either idle, sesshin, SIMT or UR.)

<p>
On average the retreat center consumes <code>108</code> kWh per
day outside sesshin.  During sesshin this increases by
<code>174</code> percent to <code>295</code> kWh per day
and during a SIMT retreat the corresponding increase is
<code>114</code> percent to <code>230</code> kWh
per day. (The UR electricity consumption is only slightly above
that for sesshin.)
</p>

<p>
Assuming that the average price of electricity for Chapin Mill is
<code>10</code> cents per killowatt hour the amount spent
on electricity per day during idle, sesshin/UR and SIMT periods is
about
<code>11</code>,
<code>30</code>, and

The natural gas model is
\[
  y = \alpha_0 + \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
			\alpha_1x + \epsilon &
			  \mbox{for idle periods} \\
			\alpha_2x + \epsilon &
			  \mbox{for sesshin periods} \\
			\alpha_3x + \epsilon &

			\alpha_4x + \epsilon &
			  \mbox{for UR periods}
			\end{array}
		 \right.
  \]
</p>

<p>
Here, \(y\) is the rate of gas consumption in hundreds of cubic feet
per day, \(x\) is average negative temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
(described below), and \(\epsilon\) is the normally distributed
error.
</p>

<p>
The observations/experimental units used to build the model are
usually periods of around two days which corresponds to the
frequency with which I noted gas and electricity
consumption. Because Ensemble samples the temperature about every 15
minutes a period can include on the order of 200 different
temperature readings. If \(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\) are the temperature
readings for a period then for \(i = 1,2,\ldots,n-1\) let
\[
  t^*_i = (t_{i+1}+t_i)/2,
  \]
let \(h_i\) be the length of time between readings \(i\) and \(i+1\), and
finally let
\[
  x = \frac{\sum_1^{n-1} h_i(65-t^*_i)_+}{\sum_1^{n-1} h_i}
  \]
where the notation \((w)_+\) means that \((w)_+ = \max(0,w)\). Thus \(x\)
is the average degrees below 65 for the period, or in other words,
\(x\) is the average degree-days per day.
